# Decentralized Medical Records with AI Health Summaries

This repository is for our CS-4800 Software Engineering project (AI Team). The AI Summary Service automatically reads medical notes or lab reports and produces short, easy-to-read summaries. It supports doctors and patients by highlighting key information and potential risks while ensuring privacy and security.
